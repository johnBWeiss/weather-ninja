## Weather Ninja is a full stack web app. You start off with getting the weather according to your geolocation. Then you can search for any city in the world by name and get the weekly forecast along with some interesting details. You can even add to a list of favorties, toggle between farenheight and celsius, and toggle dark mode and light mode. Even the errors you will see have a cool twist to them, be sure to check it out!
